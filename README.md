## About

This is a wrapper library for IndexedDB to be used with AngularJS. This is for testing and development on another project.

## Examples

Check out the sample app in the [example branch](https://github.com/emil10001/angular-indexeddb/tree/example_implementation) for some idea of how to use this thing.

Another app that uses this is [podRad.io](https://github.com/emil10001/podrad.io).
